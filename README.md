# Penguin-Project

This GitHub repository is intended to help you produce a linear regression model of penguin culmen length against depth. Note, this can be modified by changing to the desired factors. Before doing so, test your linear regression model for normality and homogeneity of variance using the plot() function.

To ensure you can run the code locally, you will need to ensure you install all of the packages mentioned, download the raw data, and follow the instructions to create your own replicate folders containing the raw data, clean data and the functions needed to clean and plot this data.

Make sure to download the entire repository and keep all files within the same working directory to run the code locally.
